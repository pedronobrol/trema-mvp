# Marketing assistant (pre-chatGPT project) 

Initial commit: May 14, 2022 

ChatGPT launched on November 30, 2022.

I am now making public some of my side projects on my GitHub to build up my portfolio. This app may seem outdated after the release of ChatGPT, but it was developed before that, and the idea of using language models to assist with writing tasks was quite innovative at the time. The app builds a prompt based on the user's inputs.
